# DrugOverdose
Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States

# Problem Statement 
What year, race, and age had the highest drug overdose death ?

# Hypothesis
I think the year with the highest drug overdose deaths is going to be in the early 2000's, the race with the highest drug overdose deaths is going to be white, and the age with the highest drug overdose death will be between 18-25 yrs.

# how you intend to use the data to validate your hypothesis
I will be using the data by looking at the columns that have data on the ages, race, and years to prove my hypothesis correct.
